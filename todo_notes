TODO: When users make a booking, to send mail to predefined person or HR general mail

>>>> in settings configure the mailing:

EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.pronetgaming.com'  # change according to pronet smtp
EMAIL_PORT = 123  # change according to mail server port
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'someones-mail@pronetgaming.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'mail-password'   # Hide it in .env file and use decouple.
                                        # Use an app password, not your real password
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = EMAIL_HOST_USER


>>>> make in views or utils a mail sender:

from django.core.mail import send_mail
from django.conf import settings

def send_booking_email(user, booking):
    subject = f"New Parking Booking - {booking.date}"
    message = f'User {user.nickname} has booked a parking space for {booking.date}.'

    recipient_email = 'someone@pronetgaming.com'  # Change this to your recipient's email

    send_mail(
        subject,
        message,
        settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL,
        [recipient_email],
        fail_silently=False,
    )


>>>> add in the create booking views a send action:

send_booking_email(request.user, booking)  # Send email after booking


>>>> alternatively, you can make an html template for the mail, so it's prettier and send it instead of ugly plain text

def send_booking_email(user, booking):
    subject = f"New Parking Booking - {booking.date}"

    # render email content using the HTML template
    html_content = render_to_string("emails/booking_confirmation.html", {
        "user": user,
        "booking": booking
    })
    text_content = strip_tags(html_content)  # fallback plain text version

    recipient_email = "someone@pronetgaming.com"  # change to recipient's email

    email = EmailMultiAlternatives(
        subject=subject,
        body=text_content,
        from_email=settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL,
        to=[recipient_email]
    )

    email.attach_alternative(html_content, "text/html")  # attach the HTML version
    email.send()


>>>> replace the logic from plain text to the html, for example like:
                send_booking_email(request.user, booking)  # Send HTML email



>>>> similar princible as above can be applied to send a PDF instead by using weasyprint module
